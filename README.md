This App simply uses 2 kinds of timers triggered by buttons to add or remove Items from a RecyclerView.

- The first category of timers is every 3 seconds, and it allows adding one Item
- The second category of timers is every 4 seconds and it allows removing an Item

 A button “producer” allows the creation of a timer from the first category (adding 1 Item every 3 seconds)

 A button “consumer” allows the creation of a timer from the second category (removing 1 Item every 4 seconds)

I am using RecyclerView and CardView, I will use combination of Kotlin & Java
